# demohelmapp
This Helm Chart template creates infrastructure as a code project in typescript that deploys a Helm chart to an existing cluster using Pulumi. It uses Pulumiâ€™s Native Kubernetes Provider to create a new namespace in an existing Kubernetes cluster and a new Helm chart that deploys an application (in this case, the Nginx ingress controller). The template generates a complete infrastructure as a code program, including sample application code, to give you a working project out of the box that you can customize easily and extend to suit your needs.
